                Stephen Hawking was one of the most famous and influential scientists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Born in Oxford, England in 1942, Hawking developed an interest in science and mathematics at an early age. He studied natural science at University College, Oxford, and later received his PhD in physics from the University of Cambridge. <br> <br>
                Hawking is best known for his work on the nature of black holes and the origin of the universe. In the 1970s, he made the groundbreaking discovery that black holes are not entirely black, but rather emit a small amount of radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This discovery helped to reconcile the laws of quantum mechanics and general relativity, two fundamental theories in physics that had previously been thought to be incompatible.
                In addition to his scientific research, Hawking was also a passionate science communicator, and wrote several popular science books, including "A Brief History of Time," which became a bestseller and helped to make him a household name. In the book, Hawking attempted to explain the complex concepts of space, time, and the nature of the universe to a general audience. <br> <br>
                Despite being diagnosed with a form of motor neuron disease at the age of 21, Hawking lived for more than five decades and became one of the most famous scientists in the world. Despite being confined to a wheelchair and needing a computer to communicate, he continued to work and travel widely, giving lectures and presentations on a wide range of scientific topics. <br> <br>
                In addition to his scientific contributions, Hawking was also known for his wit and humor. He appeared on several television shows, including "The Big Bang Theory" and "The Simpsons," and was the subject of a biographical film, "The Theory of Everything," which won several awards.
                Hawking passed away in 2018 at the age of 76, but his contributions to science and his legacy as a brilliant and inspiring scientist will be remembered for generations to come.
                Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on "Space-time in the Large".
